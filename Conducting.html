  <h3 style="font-family: candara">Conducting</h3>
  <p style="font-family: candara">Whilst at university, Charlie’s passion for orchestral music took off. This started off as being interested in orchestral pieces with good brass parts. This then developed into being interested in the music itself. It was at this point that he thought he might want to take centre stage and conduct an orchestra. </p>
  <p style="font-family: candara">He started off by conducting the Leeds University Union Music Society (LUUMS) Sinfonia in the academic year 2020-2021, this was however during covid, so rehearsals had to take place online via zoom. This did however give him a change to develop his rehearsal technique and conducting technique and improve his confidence with leading a large group of people. </p>
  <p style="font-family: candara">The following year he then finally took on the role as the LUUMS Symphony Orchestra conductor. In his first concert with orchestra and his first concert as a conductor, he rather ambitiously decided to take on the entirety of The Planets by Gustav Holst which despite challenges, turned out to be a successful concert! Later that year he then went on to conduct Saint-Saens third symphony which was also a success! With this orchestra he also conducted works by Samuel Coleridge-Taylor, Respighi, Shostakovich, Butterworth, Rimsky-Korsakov, and Karl Jenkins.</p>
  <p style="font-family: candara">In his final year of university, he then went on to conduct the LUUMS String Orchestra. With this orchestra he was known for doing unconventional works such as Leroy Anderson’s Plink, Plank, Plunk!, Daft Punk’s Adagio for Tron and even his own pirate themed composition! With this orchestra he also conducted works by Finzi, Debussy, Respighi, and other student composers.</p>
