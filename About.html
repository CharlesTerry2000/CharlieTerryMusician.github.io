  <h3 style="font-family: candara">About</h3>
  <p style="font-family: candara">Originally from Bromley, Charlie is a recent graduate from the University of Leeds where he obtained a master’s degree in mathematics. However, alongside his studies he has dedicated many hours to playing music.</p>
  <p style="font-family: candara">He started out on piano at 6 years old, then joined the Bromley Boy Singers aged 10 and this is where his classical training in singing began. At age 12 he then picked up the trombone which he thoroughly enjoyed, and it very quickly became his main instrument. With trombone he then went on to participate in many bands and orchestras at his school and at Bromley Youth Music Trust (BYMT). He also had lessons on the organ when he was in sixth form.</p>
  <p style="font-family: candara">Outside of music, his main interest is roller coasters. He is what one would call a “roller coaster enthusiast”. As of today, he has ridden 132 different roller coasters across Europe and parts of the US. He’s even gone as far as riding the world’s tallest roller coaster! Being a Merlin Annual Passholder, he enjoys making repeat visits to Alton Towers and Thorpe Park when he finds the time.</p>
