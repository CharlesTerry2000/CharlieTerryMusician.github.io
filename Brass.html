  <h3 style="font-family: candara">Brass</h3>
  <p style="font-family: candara">Brass playing is Charlie’s most frequent activity within music. His main instrument is of course the tenor trombone, though he can also play the alto trombone, the bass trombone, and the euphonium. He does also own a trumpet and a soprano trombone, though given their small mouthpiece size, he hasn’t quite mastered them yet.</p>
  <p style="font-family: candara">Being a classical trombonist, he has played in a variety of ensembles including symphony orchestras, wind bands, brass bands, brass ensembles, and brass quintets. He has also played with jazz bands and big bands from time to time and has also played in pit bands. Out of the many ensemble types he has played with, his favourite to play in is a symphony orchestra as that’s also his favourite ensemble to list to music from.</p>
  <p style="font-family: candara">Today is currently first trombone of the Leeds Symphony Orchestra and also plays bass trombone with the Otley Brass Band.</p>
